    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I&rsquo;m a medical statistician. Quite simply, I&rsquo;m interested in clinical trial design, analysis and interpretation.</p>

<p>When I was around 16 or 17, I planned to study medicine. However, after doing some work experience and realizing how difficult that path would be, I decided to do a maths degree. Towards the end of my studies, I was fortunate to see a careers talk on Medical Statistics that led me to Lancaster University to do their MSc course &ndash; a fantastic year, and I carried on to do a PhD. My research was on:</p>

<ul>
<li>group sequential trials</li>
<li>multiple hypothesis testing</li>
<li>adaptive designs</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=obri2xMAAAAJ&hl=en">Google scholar</a></p>

<p>I stayed in Lancaster a little longer, and also had a wonderful year postdoccing at the Medical University of Vienna. This time allowed me to publish some more papers, teach, and start my statistical consultancy career.</p>

<p>I came back to the UK in 2015 to work at AstraZeneca. For two years, I worked in the early-phase oncology group, as part of clinical teams, contributing to the design of trials, and overseeing the statistical analyses conducted by CRO partners. For a further year, I worked as an internal statistical consultant as part of AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Statistical Innovation team. This was an intense, but rewarding, experience that allowed me to work on trials in many different therapy areas. A highlight was working on <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sim.8186">new methods for dealing with non-proportional hazards in immuno-oncology</a>. (Preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.11097.pdf">here</a>).</p>

<p>Since January 2019 I have been working at a start-up company <a href="https://www.ccg.ai">Cambridge Cancer Genomics</a>, where I have become very interested in statistical modelling of longitudinal circulating-tumour DNA measurements.</p>

<p>I built this website with the <a href="https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown"><strong>blogdown</strong></a> package.</p>
